⚡ Fun fact:The original name for HTML was "HyperText Markup Language Version 1.0." However, due to a clerical error, "Version 1.0" was accidentally omitted from the final document, leading to the name simply being "HTML." This oversight has become a bit of a running joke in the web development community.
